        **If there are deficiencies here, the issue will not be respond. Please understand that this is the most important section.**
        You must provide a working config based on [this](https://github.com/uga-rosa/ccc.nvim/blob/main/utils/minimal.vim). Not part of config.
        Users of packer.nvim should check to see if there any plugins left in `~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer`.
        1. Copy the base minimal config to the `~/ccc-repro.vim`.
        2. Edit `~/ccc-repro.vim` for reproducing the issue.
        3. Open `nvim -u ~/ccc-repro.vim`.
        4. Check steps to reproduce.
