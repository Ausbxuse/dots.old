# Executor And Runner

This plugin splits the cmake process to two parts, one for generating libraries and executable, one for executing the executable programs.

- For the former, we use *Executor*, including toggleterm, overseer.nvim, quickfix, and terminal.
- For the latter, we use *Runner*, also including toggleterm, overseer.nvim, quickfix, and terminal.

## TODO

We should add more detail.
